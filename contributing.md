  >- Start with `Mod:` for formatting codes or adding comment.
  >- Start with `Fix:` for fixing bug, and its ending should be ` #issue-id` if being relevant to some issue.
  >- Start with `Imp:` for improving performance.
  >- Start with `Ftr:` for adding a new feature.
  >- Start with `Add:` for adding struct function/member.
  >- Start with `Rft:` for refactoring codes.
  >- Start with `Tst:` for adding tests.
  >- Start with `Dep:` for adding depending libs.
  >- Start with `Rem:` for removing feature/struct/function/member/files.

## 3. Code Style
